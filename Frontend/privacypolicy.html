            <h2>1. Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>
                Like most website operators, Animeweb collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Animeweb’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Animeweb’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Animeweb may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Animeweb also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.animeweb.in/ blog posts. Animeweb only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Security</h2>
            <p>
                The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Advertisements</h2>
            <p>
                Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Animeweb and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
            </p>
            <h2>4. Links To External Sites</h2>
            <p>
                Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and Terms of service of every site you visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites, products or services.

            <h2>5. Animeweb uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
            <p>
                Animeweb uses remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an inquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt-out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin
            </p>

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Animeweb takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
